This is a fun game. Where a player has to guess a number. and the correct number will be shown on the basis of a random number, which was applied using Math.random() method.
on the basis of correct guessing the player will get Highscore.
score will be decreased on the basis each wrong guess. 20 chances are given to guess the correct number.
if can't guess correct number then player lose the game and has to play again.
Highscore will be generated on the basis of comparison between previous and current score.
